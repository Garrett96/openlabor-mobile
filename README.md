# openlabor-mobile (β)

Please note that this project is still in beta, so you may encounter bugs or unfinished features. It is currently designed as a standalone tool and does not have any functionality to sync with the webapp. Installation is for Android devices only and requires sideloading.

The primary value-add is the QR gen/scan and being a potential offline solution for specific use cases. If you don't absolutely need these features, I would strongly recommend just using the webapp.
